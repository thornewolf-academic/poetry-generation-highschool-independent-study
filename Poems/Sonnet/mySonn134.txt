So now I have confessed that he is thine,
And I my self am mortgaged to thy will,
Myself Ill forfeit, so that other mine
Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still:
But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,
For thou art covetous, and he is kind;
He learned but surety-like to write for me,
Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,
Thou usurer, that putst forth all to use,
And sue a friend came debtor for my sake;
So him I lose through my unkind abuse.
