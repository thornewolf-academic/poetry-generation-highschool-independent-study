If my dear love were but the child of state,
It might for Fortunes bastard be unfathered,
As subject to Times love or to Times hate,
Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered.
No, it was builded far from accident;
It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
Under the blow of thralled discontent,
Whereto th inviting time our fashion calls:
It fears not policy, that heretic,
Which works on leases of short-numberd hours,
But all alone stands hugely politic, 
That it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.
