In the old age black was not counted fair,
Or if it were, it bore not beautys name;
But now is black beautys successive heir,
And beauty slandered with a bastard shame:
For since each hand hath put on Natures power, 
Fairing the foul with Arts false borrowed face,
Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,
But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.
Therefore my mistress eyes are raven black,
Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem
At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,
Slandring creation with a false esteem:
