So shall I live, supposing thou art true,
Like a deceived husband; so loves face
May still seem love to me, though altered new;
Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:
For there can live no hatred in thine eye,
Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.
In manys looks, the false hearts history
Is writ in moods, and frowns, and wrinkles strange. 
But heaven in thy creation did decree
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;
Whateer thy thoughts, or thy hearts workings be,
Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.
